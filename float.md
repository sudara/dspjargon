## [Float](#float)
*Floating point number*

The default variable type in most DSP libraries.

A 32 bit floating point uses 23 bits to represent the significand (significant digits), 8 bits for the exponent, and 1 sign bit.

The name refers to the fact that the decimal in the number "floats" — it can be placed anywhere in the significant digits via specifying the exponent value.

They are also called single precision, as the [double](#double) uses twice the number of significant digits.

CPU speed is often measured in FLOPS, or floating points operations per second.
