## [Complex Sinusoid](#complex-sinusoid)

A signal's magnitude and phase stored together as one complex number.

Can be thought of as two sinusoids, a cosine and sine of the same frequency, offset by 90 degrees in phase.

Storing these two values in a complex number makes calculations and manipulation simpler in the frequency domain.
