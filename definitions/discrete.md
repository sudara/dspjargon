## [Discrete](#discrete)
*Discrete Time*
*Digital Signal*

A signal is discrete when it is broken down into [time series](#time-series) and represented by specific separate numbers.

This is a prerequisite for a signal to be stored in a computer.

There are discrete forms of many signal processing functions, such as the [discrete fourier transform](#discrete-fourier-transform).
