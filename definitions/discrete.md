## [Discrete](#discrete)
*Discrete Time*
*Digital Signal*

A signal is discrete when it is broken down into a [time series](#time-series) and represented by specific separate numbers called [samples](#sample).

A signal must be discrete to be stored in a computer.

There are discrete forms of many signal processing functions, such as the [discrete fourier transform](#discrete-fourier-transform).

In a math context, it's convention to refer to discrete units of time with square brackets like so `x[n]`.
