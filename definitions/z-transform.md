## [Z-transform](#z-transform)

Converts a [discrete](#discrete) signal in the [time domain](#time-domain) to the [frequency domain](#frequency-domain).

This is the type of thing that a Fourier transform does.

It's the [discrete time](#discrete) version of the [Laplace transform](#laplace-transform).
