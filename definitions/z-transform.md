## [Z-transform](#z-transform)

Maps a function of `n` ([discrete](#discrete) time such as in a [filter](#filter)), to a function of [z](#z) in the [frequency domain](#frequency-domain).

This is the type of thing that a Fourier transform does.

It's the [discrete time](#discrete) version of the [Laplace transform](#laplace-transform).
