## [Autocorrelation](#autocorrelation)
*ACF*

Similarity of a signal to a copy of itself with a variable amount of [lag](#lag).

[Cross correlation](#cross-correlation) of a signal with itself, to provide analytical insight into its [periodicity](#period) and tempo.

Autocorrelation is symmetric, which means that you only need to take the first half of values when calculating it.
