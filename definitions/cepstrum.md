## [Cepstrum](#cepstrum)

The result of performing the [inverse fourier transform](#inverse-fourier-transform) of the [logarithm](#logarithm) of a [spectrum](#spectrum).

Expresses the rate of change of [spectrum](#spectrum) over time, and is useful for investigating periodicity, presence of harmonics, etc.

The word "Cepstrum" has the first four letters of "Spectrum" reversed. How fun. Don't get me started on Quefrency...
