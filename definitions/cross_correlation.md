## [Cross Correlation](#cross-correlation)
*Sliding Dot Product*

A way to measure the similarity of 2 signals.

Multiply the 2 signals together sample by sample while sliding one of them along the other (increasing [lag](#lag)).

Mathematically very similar to [convolution](#convolution), which uses the same sliding dot product method but with one signal reversed in time.
