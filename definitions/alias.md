## [Aliasing](#aliasing)

A type of distortion that results when reconstructing an analog signal from samples.

A set of samples could technically describe more than one signal. These are referred to as aliases, which is where the name comes from.

The common occurrence of this is trying to represent a signal higher than your [nyquist](#nyquist) frequency.
