## [Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) Filter](#IIR)

A recursive [filter](#filter) that relies on previous inputs and outputs, making some frequencies go to infinity.

This is what 99.9% of analog [filters](#filter) are, including all the fancy names like Butterworth, Chebyshev, Moog Ladder Filter.

Named because the output could theoretically keep going on forever, even after the input stops, so the [impulse response](#impulse-response) is technically infinite.

Example:

A [feedback delay](#feedback_delay) theoretically will always output some smaller and smaller signal, even after the input signal stops.
