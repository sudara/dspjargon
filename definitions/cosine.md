## [Cosine](#cosine)

Given an angle in a triangle, cosine is equal to ratio of the length of the side adjacent to the length of the hypotenuse. 

On the unit circle (where the radius of 1 is the hypotenuse), it's the value of the x coordinate. 

One of the three main trigonometric functions.

A cosine wave starts 1/4 cycle (90 degrees) earlier than a sine wave.
