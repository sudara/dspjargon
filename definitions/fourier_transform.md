## [Fourier Transform](#fourier-transform)

A mathematical transform that converts a function of [amplitude](#amplitude) over time (a [signal](#signal)) into [complex](#complex-numbers) numbers containing [magnitude](#magnitude) and [phase](#phase).

It's used as a noun for a signal's representation in the [frequency domain](#frequency-domain).

The transform is reversible. See [inverse Fourier transform](#inverse-fourier-transform).
