## [Linear Feedback Shift Register](#linear-feedback-shift-register)
*LFSR*

An efficient way of generating deterministic, psuedo-random numbers.

A set of individual bits that shift to the right on each iteration (shift register), where the leftmost "input" bit is created by combining other bits, often via [XOR](#xor).
