## [Interference](#interference)
*constructive interference*
*destructive interference*

An complicated way to say that an signal has combined with another signal, producing a third signal.

When that third resultant signal has less [amplitude](#amplitude) than the original, we call it "destructive". When the third signal has more amplitude, we call it "constructive."
