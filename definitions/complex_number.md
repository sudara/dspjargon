## [Complex Number](#complex-number)

Fundamentally, a complex number is a way to store and treat two numbers (a [vector](#vector)) as if they were one.

It's a number that consists of a real part and an an imaginary part bundled together in one package such as `5 + 4i`. The imaginary part is the part with the imaginary unit `i`.

In dsp and electrical engineering, `j` is  used as the imaginary unit instead of `i` (which often denotes current).

Complex numbers are graphed on the [complex plane](#complex-plane).
