## [Feedback Delay](#feedback-delay)
*Feedback Comb Filter*
*Recirculating Delay*

A copy of the output is added back to the input signal after a certain time.

Considered an [IIR](#IIR) filter because given an input signal, it theoretically keeps producing output forever.

The comb filter peaks produced by the feedback delay are tighter and more narrow and spiky than the [feedforward delay](#feedforward-delay).
