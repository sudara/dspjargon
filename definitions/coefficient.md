## [Coefficient](#coefficient)
*Multiplicative Factor*

A number.

A number that's used for scaling things, such as the [magnitude](#magnitude) of a signal.

In the case of a [feedforward delay](#feedforward-delay) like the following, the 1.5 and 0.5 are both coefficients.

$$y[n] = 1.5x[n-1] + 0.5x[n]$$

In Fourier Analysis, the magnitude and phase of a particular frequency bin are referred to as "the coefficients".
