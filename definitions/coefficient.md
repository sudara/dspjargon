## [Coefficient](#coefficient)
*Multiplicative Factor*

A number.

Probably a number that's used for scaling things, such as the [magnitude](#magnitude).

In Fourier Analysis, the magnitude and phase of a particular frequency bin are coefficients.

In the case of a [feedforward delay](#feedforward-delay) it would be the magnitude of a delayed signal added to an input signal, let's say 0.7.
