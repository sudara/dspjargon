## [Finite Impulse Response (FIR) Filter](#FIR)
*Feed Forward Filter*

A type of [filter](#filter) where some frequencies go to zero.

These filters only exist digitally, analog filters are all [IIR](#IIR).

Named because the [impulse response](#impluse_response) is finite and the filter is stable, no feedback is possible.

Example: A normal, non-feedbacking delay. When the input stops, the output stops (after the delay line empties out).
