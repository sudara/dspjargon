## [Discrete Fourier Transform](#DFT)

A practical implementation of the [Discrete Time Fourier Transform](#DTFT) that computers can perform.

Converting a [discrete](#discrete) signal from the [time domain](#time_domain) to the [frequency domain](#frequency-domain).

This is how we get the [z-transform](#z-transform)

There are a million things named Something Something Fourier Transform. This is a category just means it's  digital domain.

It's called a transform because it takes a function of one variable (time) and transforms it to a function of another (frequency).

It results in [complex numbers](#complex_numbers).

Its implementation performs the [inner product](#inner_product) of the signal with sine waves of different frequencies to check which sine waves are present.
