## [Linear Time Invariant (LTI) Filter](#LTI)

This is a category of filters that are:

1. Linear, which means the sum of two signals going through a filter results in the same output as when they go through the filter individually and get summed afterwards.

2. Time Invariant, which means a sample going through the filter is always going to have the same output no matter WHEN it goes through.
