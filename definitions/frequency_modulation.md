## [Frequency Modulation Synthesis](#frequency-modulation-synthesis)
*FM synthesis*
*FM*
*Phase Modulation*

One signal called the "modulator" changes the pitch of another signal called the "carrier" to create rich harmonic and inharmonic sounds.

Technically it's the phase of a carrier signal that's modulated by the modulator, so FM synthesis is actually  phase modulation (not frequency modulation).
