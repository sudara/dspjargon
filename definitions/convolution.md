## [Convolution](#convolution)

Operation where a signal gets combined with another signal, often an [impulse response](#impulse-response), to form a third signal.

Mathematically, the operator used is the star * which is confusing since the star is used to represent multiplication in most programming languages.

Algorithmically, you slide the impulse response over the signal, multiplying

Convolution in the [time domain](#time-domain) is equal to multiplication in the [frequency domain](#frequency-domain)
