## [Hard Sync](#hard-sync)

One [oscillator](#oscillator) causes second oscillator to reset its [cycle](#cycle) on the first's schedule, forcing their frequencies to be the same. 

Assuming the original frequency of the second oscillator isn't the exact same as the first, the result is more complex waveforms with desirable harmonics.
