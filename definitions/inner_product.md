## [Inner Product](#inner_product)
*Dot Product*
*Scalar Product*

The main thing that the [discrete fourier transform](#DFT) does.

Take two signals, walk through each element, multiply them together, then sum up the products to get a single value.

It measures the similarity, or amount of correlation, two signals have.
