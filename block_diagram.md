## [Block Diagram](#block_diagram)

High level visual description of how a signal flows through a system.

It's a rough sketch to give you a general idea of what's going on.

It's NOT a detailed schematic diagram which uses standardized symbolic representations of components or a circuit diagram (which shows electrical connections).
