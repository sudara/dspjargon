## [Fast Fourier Transform](#fast_fourier_transform)

Algorithmic technique invented in 1965 making it much more efficient to compute the [discrete fourier transform](#discrete_fourier_transform)

The time it takes to compute the [DFT](#DFT) increases exponentially N^2 with the size of the of the signal, whereas the FFT is N log N.
